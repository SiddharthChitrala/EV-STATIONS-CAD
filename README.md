## Prerequisites

Before you can run and deploy the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL) for station data storage
- Map and geolocation APIs (e.g., Google Maps API)
- Any additional dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation
